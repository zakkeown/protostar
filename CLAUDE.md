# Ouroboros — Specification-First AI Development

> Before telling AI what to build, define what should be built.
> As Socrates asked 2,500 years ago — "What do you truly know?"
> Ouroboros turns that question into an evolutionary AI workflow engine.

Most AI coding fails at the input, not the output. Ouroboros fixes this by
**exposing hidden assumptions before any code is written**.

1. **Socratic Clarity** — Question until ambiguity ≤ 0.2
2. **Ontological Precision** — Solve the root problem, not symptoms
3. **Evolutionary Loops** — Each evaluation cycle feeds back into better specs

```
Interview → Seed → Execute → Evaluate
    ↑                           ↓
    └─── Evolutionary Loop ─────┘
```
